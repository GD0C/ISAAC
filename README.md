## 🔐 About ISAAC

ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) designed by Bob Jenkins.

This project is a **multi-language, educational implementation** of ISAAC — built to teach, inspire, and demonstrate real cryptographic systems in action. Maintained under the [**greatest-docs**](https://github.com/GD0C) GitHub organization, this repo is part of a broader initiative to build **clear, clean, and deeply understandable technical docs and code**.

> ISAAC is known for its speed, simplicity, and security — making it ideal for:
> 
> - 🎮 Game networking (e.g., RuneScape packet obfuscation)
> - 🔍 Security research and CTF tooling
> - 🎲 Procedural generation
> - 💻 Systems programming
